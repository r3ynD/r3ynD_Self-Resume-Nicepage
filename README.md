My first experience "Nicepage"

<h2>Theory:</h2>
<h4> Nicepage is a user-friendly conditional-free website builder with free hosting capabilities. What makes Nicepage convenient is its wide array of website templates and corresponding components that can be easily edited and customized. Users also have the ability to create their own website templates and components for future publication.
Nicepage is suitable even for inexperienced website developers who may not have a strong grasp of HTML/CSS, as well as people who are unfamiliar with front-end/back-end development. Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and customizable component settings make it easy to learn and create websites using this website builder.</h4>

<h3>Project interface:</h3>

<h2>Preparing to work and used components:</h2>

- Dowmload and install <a href="https://nicepage.com/">Nicepage</a> to your PC (Windows/macOS)

- Register a Nicepage account (free subscribe enough) and <Sing in> in the application to have access to your projects and online templates

- Create a project using a template ID <a href="https://nicepage.com/ru/t/3847937/nemnogo-obo-mne-shablon"><3847937></a>
  
- Using a <a href="https://color.adobe.com/ru/create/color-wheel">Adobe Color Wheel </a> to change the main colors of the template and make it pleasing to the eye (at your discretion)
