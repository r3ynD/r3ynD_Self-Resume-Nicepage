My first experience "Nicepage"

<h2>Theory:</h2>
<h3> Nicepage is a user-friendly conditional-free website builder with free hosting capabilities. What makes Nicepage convenient is its wide array of website templates and corresponding components that can be easily edited and customized. Users also have the ability to create their own website templates and components for future publication.
Nicepage is suitable even for inexperienced website developers who may not have a strong grasp of HTML/CSS, as well as people who are unfamiliar with front-end/back-end development. Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and customizable component settings make it easy to learn and create websites using this website builder.</h3>
<h2>Preparing to work:</h2>
- Dowmload and install <a href="https://nicepage.com/">Nicepage</a> to your PC (Windows/macOS)
- Register a Nicepage account (free subscribe enough) and <Sing in> in the application to have access to your projects and online templates
